We undertook the following work in the development of the BubbleTea milk tea ordering app:
1. Built the overall architecture and project directory structure of the app. The BubbleTea project is divided into four main modules: Helpers, Model, Resources, and Views (Lingjing, Yunxi, Yaning).

2. Model layer development (Yunxi):
Designed the data models for the app, including the definition of milk tea products (BubbleTea) and order data (ModelData).

3. UI interface development (Lingjing):
* Implemented the UI layout and interaction logic for the milk tea product list pages (BubbleTeaMainView, MenuView, BubbleTeaRow, BubbleTeaDetailView).
* Completed the development of the shopping cart page CartView.
* Implemented the payment method selection page PayMethodView.
* Developed the order confirmation page OrderConfirmationView.

4. Project resource management (Yaning, Yunxi):
* Classified and managed the resource files, such as images used by the app, in the Resources directory. 

5. Functional module division (Yaning, Yunxi):
* Divided the app into clear functional modules such as milk tea product browsing, shopping cart, payment, and order confirmation. Created corresponding view files for each functional module, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.
